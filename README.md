# CSS Grid Playground

A tool to help understand how CSS Grid works, and to help create CSS Grid layouts.

Still a **work in progress** and there are likely to be bugs present, so please submit any that you find.

In an effort to eliminate any build process and to make it easy to deploy, all the code is kept in simple files and are definitely not adhering any high quality code standards or best practices! I hope to improve this at a later date as this was merely a weekend project.
